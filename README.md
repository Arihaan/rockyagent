Rocky is an agent framework designed for investment DAOs that streamlines processes, crowdsources group knowledge, and accelerates idea execution. The framework consists of three Telegram bots that work together to manage the entire investment process from pitch submission to execution.

## ü§ñ Bot Agents

### Agent 1: Founder Bot
- Speaks to inbound founders via Telegram DMs
- Collects and processes pitch submissions
- Uses GPT-4o to structure and summarize pitches
- Provides founders with status updates on their pitches

### Agent 2: Deal Bot
- Shares pitch summaries with DAO members in the group chat
- Facilitates deal discussions and voting
- Manages proposal creation and feedback collection
- Executes approved investment proposals with on-chain transactions
- Shows treasury balance and transaction history
- Implements a points system to reward member contributions

### Agent 3: Investor Bot
- Serves individual DAO members for private interactions
- Allows members to request founder contact information
- Provides personalized AI-generated introductions to founders
- Enables private feedback submission on pitches
- Shows detailed project information

## üìä Database Structure (Supabase)

- **Points Transactions**: Logs all points awarded to members

## üí∞ Blockchain Integration

- Connects to Base Sepolia Testnet (Chain ID: 84532)
